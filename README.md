# Gregs-Adventure
A small game I am currently making as a school project/task
It started when I made the caracter and a friend of mine said "You should make a game out of that". So In the own projects classes I work on it, and maybe a little freetime if I feel like it.

The game is about greg which is going on an adventure... *more story comming soon*

## How to play?
1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure python (Downloaded from their website on windows and a package managers on linux) and pygame (Installed with pip: `pip install pygame`) is installed
3. run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` if that don't work
